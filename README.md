# Disney Villains
This site is somewhere for people like me who loves the bad guys of the Disney world to go and learn a little more about those characters who are out to stop the good guys. This project is the basis of what can become something much larger with more characters being added as the Disney franchise grows.The first page is to introduce users to the site and includes a timeline of all the villains mentioned in the later pages and those who are featured in the header image.

There are 4 other pages, two for each gender of villain, with an image of said villain and also a basic look at who they are and which movie they are from etc. There is also a more detailed page with all the character Biographies on which feature more in depth look at the characters themselves. The final page is for the site user to have their say and choose a villain who is not listeed on the site already and to have them included in a future site release. 

The goal of this website is for people who are a fan of the Disney franchise (villains in particular) to be able to see the characters that they love, all in one place and can read up about them and see where they fall in the Disney movie timeline and find out what makes that character unique.

# UX

## Strategy

Following the core UX principles I firstly decided on my target audience and I decided what I would want to see if I was interested in this particular topic.

### Disney Villain Target Audience:

* People of all ages
* Disney fans
* Those with a love for the bad guys of the Disney world

### What the users would want from the website:

* Informal language
* Ease of navigation between pages
* Mobile friendly so must be responsive
* Visually appealing and contains relevant information about the topic

### The website is best for users:

* Most websites that are similar to this one, feature the good guys also and they can sometimes over-shadow the villain of the movie.
* Many people who share the interest in the Disney Villain franchise would need to scour through huge websites where they will eventually come across the information/ characters they wish to see information about. So this website provides what the individual is looking for all in one place.
