# Disney Villains

This website is somewhere for people, like me, who enjoy the bad guys of the Disney world. They can learn more about the characters who are out to stop the good guys. This project is the basis of what can become something much larger, with more characters being added as the Disney franchise grows. 

The first page is an introduction for users of the site and includes a timeline of all the villains mentioned in the later pages and those who are featured in the header image. There are three main pages focused on the villains themselves, one for each gender of villain, with an image of each and a basic look at who they are and which movie they are from etc. The third page is more detailed with all the character biographies in which feature a more in depth look at the characters themselves. The final page in the website is for the site user to have their say and choose a villain who is not listed on the site already and to have them included in a future site release. 

The goal of this website is for people who are a fan of the Disney franchise (villains in particular) to be able to see the characters that they love, all in one place and can read up about them and see where they fall in the Disney movie timeline and find out what makes that character unique.

## Business Goals

* Gathering place for Disney Villain fans
* Raise the villains fan base
* Introduce people to the villains and a bit of their history

## Customer Goals

* Easy to navigate website structure
* Quick and simple descriptions
* Visually appealing
* Social media links and a link to a wiki page that houses everything Disney 

# UX

## Strategy

Following the core UX principles I firstly decided on my target audience and I decided what I would want to see if I was interested in this particular topic.

### Disney Villain Target Audience:

* People of all ages.
* Disney fans.
* Those with a love for the bad guys of the Disney world.

### What the users would want from the website:

* Informal language.
* Ease of navigation between pages.
* Mobile friendly so must be responsive.
* Visually appealing and contains relevant information about the topic.

### The website is best for users:

* Most websites that are similar to this one, feature the good guys also and they can sometimes over-shadow the villain of the movie.
* Many people who share the interest in the Disney Villain franchise would need to scour through huge websites where they will eventually come across the information/ characters they wish to see information about. So this website provides what the individual is looking for all in one place.

## Scope

To acheive the goals I had set out for this website I included the following features:

* Header with page Logo. 
* Large image to show which villains will be featured.
* Easy to use navigation menu.
* Seperate pages for male and female villains.
* Combined biography page for all villains featuring 9 of them.
* Borders around the information to make it stand out.
* Footer to contain a subscribe feature and the links to various social media platforms.

## Structure

I chose the file names that I did as they were easy to define what the relevant page was about. Due to the amount of information I wanted to put into the site and the use of images so people could see what each character looks like 1 page wasn't enough so I chose to do 5 pages in total. The menu is consistent throughout the website and the names of each page are easy to follow. The main page is simple and contains a brief overview to the site, then the timeline of the featured villains and their corresponding movie, then a song medley of various villains music from their movies and then the footer at the bottom of the page.

Both the male and female villain pages are the same in structure, the way I structured it was to help the information not look cramped on the page and the added images were used as a visual aid and they are also linked to the biographies page so when you click a villain portrait, you are taken to the corresponding biography.

## Skeleton

I created quick sketches of what I wanted the website to look like in Excel as it was easy to define the space and the frame of the site in its basic form.

## Surface

The colour scheme of the website was chosen to provide simplicity and to match the colours that similar websites would use for the Disney villains. The logo colour was chosen as it stood out on the grey background and is a colour that features on some of the characters. The grey background was chosen as it is a solid basic colour that made th purple colour stand out and the images stand out against it.

I chose the font Cinzel Decorative throughout as it looked good for the website and was very suited to the theme of the website. This font by default uses all uppercase which meant the user is able to clearly read the words and follow the site structure. Sans-serif was used as the default go to in case my chosen font couldn't be loaded. I used a hover effect on the navigation bar to attract attention and demonstrate the ease of navigation across all pages.

# Features

## Navigation Bar

All five pages have a fully functioning navigation bar which includes links to the Home, Female VIllains, Male Villains, Villain Bios and Request a villain pages, these are identical on each page to keep the website consistent. This allows the user to navigate to whichever page they require. Also the main logo is a link to the home page so clicking this will revert the user back to the home page.

## Villain Outlines

The villain outline pages were done as a first port of call for the user to see the villains and find out the basics about each one. Each image is then a link to their name on a further page that gives a more in depth look at each villain and what they're about.

## Villain Biographies

The villain bio page provides a more in depth look at the villains. It details the movie and the basic plot as well as giving a bit more of a background for the character which the previous website pages don't provide.

## Request a Villain

The Request a Villain page give the user a chance to request a villain that is currently missing from the site. As the site is in early stages there are many more villains out there to be added so giving people the chance to be a part of that process is one way to encourage return site users.

## Footer

The footer houses social media links to a Facebook page dedicated to Disney Villains, an Instagram page for Disney VIllains and the wiki page for all things Disney. I have also included an option for the user to sign up to a newsletter so they would get an email when a new villain is added.
